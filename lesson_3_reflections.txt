When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Remote repository is good for sharing and collaborating your work with other
people or when you're working from different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually enables me to see in what state the remote repository is.
For example Might be that the branch I'm currently working on locally has been
significantly changed in the remote repository in a way it would bring
hardship for me to finish whatever I may be currently working on.


Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks is a clone on GitHub. 
Clone is a copy of a repository either locally or remotely. 
Branch is a series of commits exceeding one another by their changes.
Fork would be used on GitHub to clone a repository that you would like to make
changes to, but don't have access.
Clone would be used to copy that repository to your computer. This way you can
make changes locally if necessary. For example writing some code.
Branch would be used in this cloned repository for example to create a new
feature to test it out. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

It allows you to see the state of the remote offline and compare your changes
to it. 


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier and
what would be harder?

One option would be to meet up with the people who I would be collaborating
with. It would be easier to brainstorm and work on different features and
implementations of the project. It would be harder to meet up with different
people at any certain point of time. It would require planning and most
probably would last from a few to a couple of hours. It would be extremely
difficult to collaborate with people living far apart.
