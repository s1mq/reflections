When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Remote repository is good for sharing and collaborating your work with other
people or when you're working from different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually enables me to see in what state the remote repository is.
For example Might be that the branch I'm currently working on locally has been
significantly changed in the remote repository in a way it would bring
hardship for me to finish whatever I may be currently working on.
