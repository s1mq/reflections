What happesn when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository with git init, I create a hidden .git directory
in that directory that will start saving my commits. I need to do it to save
commits in my repository. So I can easily backtrack my versions and/or find
bugs that I may have made throughout time.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a mid-ground where you may add files which would be included
in your next commit. Staging area allows me to commit specifically those files
I want to.


How can you use the staging area to make sure taht you have one commit per
logical change?

Stagin area is middle ground between the working directory and the repository.
When I make multiple logical changes in multiple files, I can use the staging
area to commit each of those changes separately or together if need be.
