What happesn when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository with git init, I create a hidden .git directory
in that directory that will start saving my commits. I need to do it to save
commits in my repository. So I can easily backtrack my versions and/or find
bugs that I may have made throughout time.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a mid-ground where you may add files which would be included
in your next commit. Staging area allows me to commit specifically those files
I want to.
